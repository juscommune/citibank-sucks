            <h1>Citibank, Citi Bank, Citigroup and First Data Sucks.</h1>
            <h2>Why does Citibank suck?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-text">There is no way of contacting Citibank's credit card department if there is any issue at all with your ID verification, no matter how small. <br><br>
                Even if you go into a Citibank branch with your driver's license and passport Citibank staff refuse to assist you. <br><br>
                Citibank's staff say you must call their fraud department, however, when you call them and they cannot ID you, again because of their flawed system they just hang up on you. It is an impossible situation! <br><br>
                Even if you write and mail (post) Citibank with certified copies of your ID they refuse to deal with you. Citibank will not even allow you to cancel your credit card and keep charging you fees for a credit card you cannot even use.</li>
                <li class="list-text">Citibank's KYC is extremely difficult to pass if there is the smallest of issues with your ID such as having a middle name or slightly different address such as Unit instead of Suite or a # symbol etc.<br><br>
                Citibank staff are pigheaded about this and say your records must match perfectly with Google's address system etc. It is ridiculous.</li>
                <li class="list-text">When you call a 3rd party such as Clover, the calls are automatically forwarded to Citibank's merchant services team who do not identify themselves as Citibank, only merchant services. So, if you ask for any changes to your account which you believe are ONLY for your Clover account you are inadvertently changing your Citibank merchant account and once they make the changes they refuse to undo them, even though they have not made it clear that you are in fact talking with Citibank merchant services and not Clover. It is a joke and there is nothing you can do about it.</li>
                <li class="list-text">Citibank does not have any way to lodge a formal complaint online. They have no webform or email address and your Citibank manager cannot or will refuse to assist you with any problems you have with Citibank.</li>
                <li class="list-text">If you lodge a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) Citibank will totally ignore it and you, and Citibank will take no notice of your complaint.</li>
                <li class="list-text">Citibank has a poorly narrated IVR (telephone voice) system and will transfer you from department to department and cause you great frustration and irritation</li>
                <li class="list-text">Poor customer service with limited trading hours</li>
                <li class="list-text">Understaffed and indifferent support staff</li>
                <li class="list-text">Wait times at branches is often more than 30 minutes</li>
                <li class="list-text">Very low earning on savings and term deposits i.e. Citibank will rip you off</li>
                <li class="list-text">Excessively difficult to obtain a home or business loan because of Citibank's onerous requirements</li>
                <li class="list-text">Extremely high merchant fees and costs</li>

            </ul>
